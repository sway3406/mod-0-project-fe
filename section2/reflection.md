## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  a) The first point that resonated with me is the topic itself. I am an advocate and practitioner of having a growth mindset. I especially appreciated the the part in the first blog article about setting SMART goals. I have found applying this acronym to my life has been very helpful.

  b) The second point from the blog post that I appreciated is the notion of "being uncomfortable," as a space for the most growth. It's a somewhat narrow space, but nonetheless, it is when we our challenged, embrace that challenge, and accept that we are going to struggle yet persevere that we can often times find the most growth in ourselves.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  a) I think I have embraced a growth mindset for most of my life. Even before I knew what it was. I have always enjoyed challenging myself. However, the other side of that coin is that I think I have limited my potential by letting either fear of failure, or fear of success block me from pushing myself to achieve things that I am not sure I am capable of.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  a) I struggled at times with writing some of the code and wrestling with the pizza problem. I both embraced the challenge and was a bit frustrated at times. As for the more procedural aspects of moving between the editor, terminal and managing my git workflow I felt pretty comfortable as I have been practicing. I would say that the elements that became more vague were good and forced my to recall all the steps that go into a command rather than simply re-typing instructions. It felt more empowering to know that I remembered how to do all the steps.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  - Simply put, conditional statements will return a true or false solution and are necessary in effectively setting up statements.
        Example 1) If I want to be successful at Turing, I'll have to work hard and have a growth mindset.
        Example 2) If user enters incorrect password, then display "incorrect password, please enter again"

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  - To add multiple conditions to an if-statement one would follow the if/else if/else structure. The program will evaluate the entry against each condition and once it has identified the correct conditional line the program will execute the result of what that condition is programed to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  - I can run a node in the terminal of the file I am working in and check the output of the conditions and if they are being satisfied.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  - I have a lot of questions about how to use better syntax, as well as understanding more commands to execute more robust if statements & functions. Having my minor in math makes me curious about applying programming and more rigorous mathematical expressions, maps, equations, etc., to FEE.
