## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- In general I feel comfortable asking questions and if I steer one direction more than another - I may ask questions to soon. I have always sought out mentors/teachers to learn from in life & school. I always prefer to sit front and middle, go to every office hour possible and immerse myself in new pursuits. I usually ask as many questions as I need to. However, I am always mindful of others' time, space and comfort. So I try my best to ask appropriate questions in the appropriate circumstances.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String - A series of characters. Usually alphabetic, numerical or symbolic. They are composed w/in " ".
Number - Is a data type that utilizes neg - positive numbers (including decimals).
Boolean - Are logic driven variables dealing in true or false statements. Think Boolean Algebra/Proof based mathematics (if/then , if and only if etc...)


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

OR

var bigHello = "Hello World!";
console.log(bigHello);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

 a) // --> Single line comments
 b) /* lots of words */ --> Multi-line commment sections
 c) Code comments help yourself and other developers understand more clearly lines of code and/or intentions behind larger blocks of code. Stylistically (if done well), they can make your code enjoyable to read and work with.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  a) Variables are identifiers that help programmers organize and store information in a logically structured environment. This environment is dynamic and changing. Which is why variables can change over time as well.
  b) (5 yr old terms) - variables are like crayons, markers and pencils. Each is its own unique type of drawing thing. Even though there is a purple crayon, marker, and pencil. They are each there own form of purple. The same goes for all the other colors each drawing tool can share. Each is unique and cannot be the other one.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

BBC News app

Strings --> News article titles, categorical news headlines (World, National, local),
Numbers --> Page numbers, total number of articles (broken down in many sub fields), subscriptions, views
Boolean --> Article read (Y/N), watched video, like/dislike, commented, reposted

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  a) concatenation is essentially "to merge". In the case of the CS application this could be merging to different data types in one. For example a number data type and a string data type into a string. However, in general to concatenate is to merge multiple strings into one string, be they the same or differing data types.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

  a) Many sites use comments sections whereby many users can opine their thoughts on a topic/video, etc. I think it would seem reasonable that the linking of distinct comments from multiple users into a common field on a browser page would a form of graphically representing the con of the strings supplied by different users.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  - The main question that I have is understanding my GH page and GH in general. It is still pretty grey and foggy for me.
