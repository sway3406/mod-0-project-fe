In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated

Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

*/


//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.

console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals [2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals [3] = "Lynx";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

animals [4] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals [4]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

var foods = ["Spinach", "Avocado", "Blueberries", "Poultry"];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

foods [4] = "Broccoli";
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed

// Removes last item in array
// Unlike using delete, the last element is removed completely and the array length reduced.
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

//OR
// Setting the length property to a value less than the current value.
// Any element whose index is greater than or equal to the new length will be removed.

var foodsNew = ["Salmon", "Kale", "Brussels Sprouts", "Cheese", "Beets"];

foodsNew.length = 4
console.log(foodsNew);


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

foods.push("Tuna", "Coconut", "Bok Choy");
console.log(foods);
console.log(foods.length);  // Updates to 7 elements

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift();       // removes index 0 (Spinach)
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Google Podcasts - There are lists of podcasters and by selecting a single podcast,
// you get a list of all their episodes.

// 2: Mountain Project - A climbing application that stores lists of routes on specific
// climbing walls (organized from L-R ideally).

// 3: Mountain Project Cont... - On each persons profile, they log all of their ascents,
// creating a chronological list of climbs completed


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 15;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";


// Write your conditional here

// Check if battery charge is at least 15%.
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 ) {
  // If true, allow user to order an Uber. Exit conditional
  console.log("Battery is greater than 15%, you may call an Uber.");
// If battery charge is less than 15%, and user has a car charger - they can call Uber.
} else if (hasCharger && chargerType) {
  // If true, allow user to order an Uber. Exit conditional
  console.log("Accepted, you may call an Uber.");
  // If battery charge is less than 15% and no car charger - they cannot call an Uber.
}  else if (percentBatteryLeft < 15 && hasCharger === false) {
  // Deny user from ordering an Uber - Exit conditional
  console.log("Uber is unavailable due to insufficent battery charge without car charger");
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
