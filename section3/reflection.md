## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

  - It was at times a bit challenging, but the challenge matched up well with the progression of the Mod 0 lessons and the progressions of the sessions & homework assignments.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  - Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the influx of people shopping online for groceries with their preferred grocery store has led to to the creation of more robust digital grocery shopping platforms. Creating large arrray's that match up with the available items in stores for customers to select from seems to be a perfect marriage for the use of arrays.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  - An array method is a function that is built into the javascript language that allows programmers to preform an operation on a list (array) relative to how they want to use/present data from a list without having to write the code from scratch.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- A loop allows programmers to iterate through large amounts of data/inputs and provide the appropriate outputs relative to  the input w/o having to manually go through each data point. Using a loop in conjunction w/ an array is useful because many arrays have a dynamic aspect built into the amount of elements they use. There may be a specific amount of conditions that the loop accounts for, but the array can hold many new elements. For fixed length arrays the loop still allows programmers to adjust the conditions as the program evolves.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- A loop is tool that allows a programmer the ability to give specific answers/directions to a person based on what they select from a set of offered questions.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  - So many, but most deal with mapping arrays onto other arrays for more complex analysis.
